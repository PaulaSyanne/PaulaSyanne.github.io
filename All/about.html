		<h3>Short story</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Born and raised in Madrid(Spain), I've always been passionate about design and videogames. As I started studying I quickly realized that the digital world was the only future, so after a few tries I ended focusing on videogames.</p>

		<p>I am a 3D designer and videogame developer currently studying in Madrid a degree in 3D Animation and Videogame Development. I belive that 3D and videogames are a process, and through research, exploration and hard work anything is achievable. I've also studied a degree in Computer Engineering by the UC3M (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid) where I've learn quite a lot about programming and many other stuff.</p>
